# csgo-win-loss-tracker
This application consists of a front end website and an API. The application was purposefully made that way to create modularity. Now, one could easily make, say, an Android application, and simply call the API instead of having to write a custom back end.

## Learning purposes
This project servers multiple learning purposes, namely to learn more about:

* front end web development (particularly JavaScript),
* using an API to seperate the front end application from the business logic,
* implementing authentication/authorization.
